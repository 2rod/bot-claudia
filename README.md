# koa-starter
A starter kit for a slightly opinionated koa project

# :koala: koa-starter
A starter kit for a slightly opinionated [koa](http://koajs.com/) project

## Prerequisites
* Node.js (Version 5 and up recommended)
* Github Client ID and Secret (for OAuth)

## Installation

* Clone down the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/snollygolly/koa-starter.git
```

* Install packages (from inside the koa-starer folder)
```
npm install
```

* Create your config.  There's a `config.json.example` file in the root.  Edit it to include all your values for the site and your OAuth information.  Save it as `config.json` and leave it in the root.

* Start it up!
```
npm start
```

## Opinions
I built this package because there's a number of packages I like to use when starting a new project.

* Koa
* Passport
* Handlebars
* Bootstrap
* FontAwesome
